    "# RAG Failure #10: The \"Common Neighbor\" Intersection Gap\n",
    "\n",
    "## The Problem\n",
    "A user asks: **\"What is the interaction risk between Drug A and Drug B?\"**\n",
    "Standard RAG retrieves documents about Drug A and Drug B. \n",
    "Even if RAG retrieves **ALL** relevant documents, LLMs often fail to synthesize **implicit indirect connections**. They prefer explicit statements. If a document says \"Drug A and B are both popular\", the LLM latches onto that superficial link, ignoring the complex technical chain: `Drug A -> Inhibits Enzyme X` and `Drug B -> Needs Enzyme X`.\n",
    "\n",
    "## The Scenario: Drug-Drug Interaction (DDI) Discovery\n",
    "**Query:** \"Is there a specific interaction risk between **Zenthorax** and **Vira-X**?\"\n",
    "\n",
    "**The Disjointed Data:**\n",
    "1.  **Doc 1 (Zenthorax Profile):** \"**Zenthorax** is a potent antifungal. It is a strong **CYP3A4 Inhibitor**.\"\n",
    "2.  **Doc 2 (Vira-X Profile):** \"**Vira-X** is a statin used for cholesterol. It is heavily metabolized by the **CYP3A4 Enzyme**.\"\n",
    "3.  **Doc 3 (The Red Herring):** \"Market Analysis: Both **Zenthorax** and **Vira-X** are FDA-approved, top-selling pills available at pharmacy counters.\"\n",
    "\n",
    "**Naive RAG Failure:** Even with full context, the LLM sees Doc 3 explicitly mentioning both drugs together. It answers: *\"Both are FDA approved pills.\"* It misses the metabolic clash (Inhibition + Metabolism = Toxic Build up).\n",
    "\n",
    "**KG Solution:** We map `Drug -> Mechanism -> Protein`. We run an intersection query. We apply a logic rule: `If A Inhibits X AND B is Metabolized by X -> DANGER`."
