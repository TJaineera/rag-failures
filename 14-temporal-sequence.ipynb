    "# RAG Failure #14: The Temporal Sequence Scramble\n",
    "\n",
    "## The Problem\n",
    "LLMs have a weak sense of time. They suffer from **Recency Bias** (preferring the last thing read) or **Presentation Bias** (assuming the order of text in the prompt is the chronological order).\n",
    "\n",
    "In RAG, the Retriever sends documents to the LLM sorted by **Relevance Score**, not by **Timestamp**. \n",
    "If you ask \"What caused the server crash?\", RAG will send the \"Server Crash\" log first (because it matches the query best), and the \"Root Cause\" log last. The LLM reads the effect *before* the cause and often fails to reconstruct the timeline correctly.\n",
    "\n",
    "## The Scenario: Cyber Security Incident Response\n",
    "**Query:** \"What was the immediate trigger event that occurred right before the **Main Database Encryption**?\"\n",
    "\n",
    "**The Log Data (The Attack Chain):**\n",
    "1.  **08:00 AM:** Phishing Email clicked by Admin.\n",
    "2.  **08:15 AM:** Malware 'Silent-Bot' installed in background.\n",
    "3.  **08:45 AM:** Privileged Access Escalation detected.\n",
    "4.  **09:00 AM (Target):** **Main Database Encryption** initiated by attacker.\n",
    "5.  **09:30 AM:** Ransom Note displayed on screens.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Naive RAG Failure (Full Context):** \n",
    "The Retriever ranks \"Ransom Note\" and \"Database Encryption\" at the top. It puts \"Phishing Email\" at the bottom. \n",
    "The LLM reads the Ransom Note first and often says: *\"The Ransom Note triggered the Encryption.\"* (Reversing cause and effect).\n",
    "\n",
    "**KG Solution:** We build a **Time-Series Graph**. Nodes are events. Edges are `NEXT_EVENT`. We find the \"Encryption\" node and look backwards (`predecessors`)."
