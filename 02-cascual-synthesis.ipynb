    "# RAG Failure #2: The Causal Synthesis Failure\n",
    "\n",
    "## The Problem\n",
    "Standard RAG is great at retrieving facts, but terrible at **applying strict rules** to those facts. \n",
    "When a user asks, \"Is X compatible with Y?\", RAG retrieves descriptions of X and Y. If those documents contain positive sentiment (e.g., \"Safe for transport\", \"High quality\"), the LLM often ignores the hidden technical incompatibility and hallucinates a \"Safe\" verdict.\n",
    "\n",
    "## The Scenario: Industrial Chemical Safety\n",
    "**Query:** \"Can I store **Titan-X** and **Solvo-Clean** in the same storage cabinet?\"\n",
    "\n",
    "**The Hidden Logic Chain:**\n",
    "1.  **Doc A:** Titan-X is a high-grade cleaning agent containing **concentrated Hydrogen Peroxide**.\n",
    "2.  **Doc B:** Solvo-Clean is an organic solvent derived from **Acetone**.\n",
    "3.  **Doc C (The Rule):** WARNING: Never mix **Peroxides (Oxidizers)** with **Organic Solvents**. Risk of spontaneous combustion.\n",
    "\n",
    "**The Adversarial Noise:**\n",
    "-   \"Titan-X is FDA approved and safe for food surfaces.\"\n",
    "-   \"Solvo-Clean is an eco-friendly, biodegradable solvent.\"\n",
    "-   \"Both products are safe for transport under regulation 99.\"\n",
    "\n",
    "Naive RAG sees \"Safe\", \"Approved\", \"Eco-friendly\" and assumes they are compatible. The Knowledge Graph will catch the specific chemical class conflict."
