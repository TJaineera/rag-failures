    "# RAG Failure #9: The Directionality Reversal\n",
    "\n",
    "## The Problem\n",
    "Vector Similarity is largely **Symmetric**. The distance between \"A owns B\" and \"B owns A\" in vector space is near-zero because they contain the exact same keywords. \n",
    "LLMs, when relying on this \"bag of words\" context, frequently **flip the relationship**, especially when sentences use passive voice or complex corporate jargon.\n",
    "\n",
    "## The Scenario: Corporate Ownership & Subsidiary Tracing\n",
    "**Query:** \"Does **Stratos Global** own **Novacorp**, or is it the other way around?\"\n",
    "\n",
    "**The Ambiguous Data:**\n",
    "1.  **Doc 1 (The Fact):** \"**Stratos Global**, formerly a standalone entity, now operates under the corporate umbrella of the massive **Novacorp** conglomerate.\"\n",
    "2.  **Doc 2 (The Distractor):** \"**Stratos Global** has aggressively expanded by acquiring smaller firms like **TinyAI**.\"\n",
    "3.  **Doc 3 (The Confusion):** \"**Novacorp** and **Stratos Global** share a unified HQ in London.\"\n",
    "\n",
    "**Naive RAG Failure:** The LLM sees \"Stratos\", \"Acquiring\", \"Novacorp\", and \"HQ\". It might hallucinate: *\"Stratos Global acquired Novacorp\"* because Doc 2 primes it with Stratos being an acquirer.\n",
    "\n",
    "**KG Solution:** We build a **Directed Graph**. We map \"operating under umbrella of\" to `Novacorp -> Stratos`. We map \"acquiring\" to `Stratos -> TinyAI`. The arrow direction is immutable."
