    "# RAG Failure #5: The Implicit Relationship Hallucination\n",
    "\n",
    "## The Problem\n",
    "Vector Search measures **Semantic Closeness**, not **Relational Truth**. \n",
    "If Entity A and Entity B appear in the same paragraph (e.g., a news summary listing industry players), they will have high vector similarity. The LLM, seeing them close together in the context window, frequently hallucinates a direct relationship (like a partnership) that does not exist.\n",
    "\n",
    "## The Scenario: Supply Chain Verification\n",
    "**Query:** \"Does **Tesla** have a battery partnership with **Toyota**?\"\n",
    "\n",
    "**The Trap (Co-occurrence Data):**\n",
    "1.  **Doc A (Truth):** \"**Panasonic** signed a verified contract to supply 4680 cells to **Tesla**.\"\n",
    "2.  **Doc B (Truth):** \"**Toyota** is independently developing its own solid-state battery technology.\"\n",
    "3.  **Doc C (The Hallucination Trap):** \"At the 2024 Global Energy Summit, executives from **Tesla**, **Toyota**, and **Samsung** gathered to discuss battery regulations.\"\n",
    "\n",
    "**Naive RAG Failure:** It retrieves Doc C because it contains \"Tesla\", \"Toyota\", and \"Battery\". The LLM infers they are working together.\n",
    "\n",
    "**KG Solution:** We use **Explicit Edge Verification**. We query the graph: `MATCH (Tesla)-[:PARTNERS_WITH]->(Toyota)`. If the edge doesn't exist, the answer is NO, regardless of how often they appear in the same text."
